    "\n",
    "Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: \"A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]\n",
    "Output: 3 \n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had \n",
    "             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. \n",
    "             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining \n",
    "             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow up:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.\n",
    "Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?"
