    "In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges is a pair [u, v] with u < v, that represents an undirected edge connecting nodes u and v.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array. The answer edge [u, v] should be in the same format, with u < v.\n",

    "Example 1:\n",

    "Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]\n",

    "Example 2:\n",

    "```\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.\n",
    "Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N, where N is the size of the input array."
